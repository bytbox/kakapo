Kakapo is an experimental lisp interpreter in Go. It aims to provide maximum
compatibility between the interpreted lisp code and any present go code. For
usage, look at repl.lsp (the most complex program written with kakapo so far)
and kakapo.go (which showcases the entire two-function api of the backing
library).
